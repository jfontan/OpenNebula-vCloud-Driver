## Description

This addon gives Opennebula the posibility to manage resources in VMware vCloud infraestructures. 
It includes virtualization and monitoring drivers.

This driver is based on [vCenter Driver](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/blob/master/src/vmm_mad/remotes/vcenter/vcenter_driver.rb) and uses a
modified version of [ruby_vcloud_sdk](https://github.com/vchs/ruby_vcloud_sdk).

## Features

This addon has the following capabilities:

* Deploy, stop, shutdown, reboot, save, suspend, resume and delete VM's in the Virtual Data Centers hosted in vCloud.
* Create, delete and revert snapshots of VM's.
* It's able to hot-attach and detach NICs to VM's.
* Automatized customization of the VMs instanciated.
* Obtain monitoring information from the VDC, Datastore and VM's.
* In this development version we manage vApps with one VMs inside (A VM in OpenNebula equals a vApp with one VM in vCloud).
* Each Virtual Data Center (VDC) in vCloud is managed as a Host in OpenNebula.
* Import networks, hosts, templates and datastores hosted in vCloud using onevcloud script.
